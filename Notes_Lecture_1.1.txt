Use of async and finish constructs

operation_1
finish {
	async operation_2;
	async operation_3;
}
operation_4;

With the above syntax, you are expressing that operation_1 occurs first. 

Operations operation_2 and operation_3 execute in parallel [parrael means assigned to independent cores]. 

Operation_4 however waits for the tasks in in the finish scope to be completed.
